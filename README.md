# ParaLink
ParaLink is an asset exchange hub based on [XCM](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/overview-summary) within Polkadot parachains. Unlike other exchange tools, it automatically supports parachains and assets that meet the [Support Requirements](#support-requirements). Once these requirements are met, your parachain and its assets are supported by ParaLink with no manual intervention, significantly simplifying integration and enhancing asset exchange efficiency for the Polkadot community.

## **Support Requirements**

ParaLink will automatically support chains that meet the following criteria:

1. The parachain is connected to another parachain via [HRMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-hrmp-channels), and the channel is active.
2. The parachain supports XCM, and the `XcmPaymentRuntimeApi` is available. For more details, refer to [this guide](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3607).

Assets within your parachains will be automatically supported if they meet the following requirement:

1. The asset is listed in the [asset-transfer-api-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api-registry), which we use to obtain asset registry details.
2. The asset should be included in the target chainâ€™s `xcmPaymentAcceptTokens` list.

As long as your parachain and assets meet these requirements, they will be automatically supported by ParaLink. Enjoy the seamless integration!
